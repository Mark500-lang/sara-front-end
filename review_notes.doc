Subject: Urgent: Subscription Approval Needed for App Review

Hello App Review Team,

Our app Sara Stories was rejected because the in-app purchases are failing during review. This is because our subscriptions are still waiting for approval.

Could you please prioritize reviewing our subscription group so that your team can properly test the purchase flow?

Subscription Group: Sara Stories Premium
Subscription IDs: 
- com.littlestories.app.premiumyearly
- com.littlestories.app.premiummonthly

Once the subscriptions are approved, we're confident the purchase flow will work correctly during review.

Thank you for your assistance.
